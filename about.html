				<h3 align="center"><u>The choir</u></h3>
				<p>The Cuddington and Sandiway Community Singers are a new community choir based in Cuddington and Sandiway, near Northwich. They were started by Marcus Williams on 19th September 2014, and sing a variety of different music. The choir welcomes singers of all ages and abilities â€“ there are no auditions, and no prior experience of singing is required.  If you enjoy singing in the shower or find yourself humming along to music, then this is for you.</p>	

				<p align="center"><b>Your first session is free, and thereafter there is a charge of &pound;2.50 a session.</b></p>
